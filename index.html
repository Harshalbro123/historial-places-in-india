          <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani:) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that
            served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red
            Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its
            design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents
            the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian
            traditions.
            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the
            project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in
            1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70
            billion (about US $1 billion).

          <p>Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometres (22 mi)
            northeast from Puri city on the coastline in Puri district, Odisha, India.[1][2] The temple is attributed to
            king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty about 1250 CE.[3][4]

            Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a 100-foot
            (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m)
            high,[1][5] much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at
            one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived
            are famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes.
            Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga
            architecture.[1][6]

          <p>Khajuraho was once the capital of the Chandela dynasty. The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, one of the best
            examples of temples preserved from the medieval period in India,[1][7] is the largest of the western group
            of temples in the Khajuraho complex which was built by the Chandela rulers. Shiva is the chief deity in the
            temple deified in the sanctum sanctorum.[8]

            The Kandariya Mahadeva temple was built during the reign of Vidyadhara (r. c. 1003-1035 CE).[9] At various
            periods of the reign of this dynasty many famous temples dedicated to Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Shakti of the
            Hindu religion and also for the Thirthankaras of Jain religion were built. Vidhyadhara, also known as Bida
            in the recordings of the Muslim historian Ibn-al-Athir was a powerful ruler who fought Mahmud of Ghazni in
            the first offensive launched by the latter in 1019.[1] This battle was not conclusive and Mahmud had to
            return to Ghazni. Mahmud again waged war against Vidhyadhara in 1022.

          <p>Humayun's tomb (Persian: Maqbara-i Humayun) is the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun in Delhi, India.[1]
            The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum under her
            patronage[2][3][4][5][6] in 1558, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad,[7]
            Persian architects chosen by her.[8][9] It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent,[10] and is
            located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, India, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old
            Fort), that Humayun found in 1538. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a
            scale.[11][12] The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993,[10] and since then has undergone
            extensive restoration work, which is complete.[

          <p>The Taj Mahal'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the
            river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to
            house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb
            is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set
            in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
